## Lessons Learned

Mapping can be a little tricky the more JSP's we add. Definitely a learning experience there.

I had to grab some help figuring out how to map the DAO Impl to the controller.

## How to run

The user is greeted with a webpage. From there they can look up a character by the various attributes. After they have looked up either the name or the ID of the character they can then select options to updated or remove them from the database. A new character can be added from the landing/homepage.
